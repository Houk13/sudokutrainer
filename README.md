# Sudoku Trainer

This project aims to create a practise tool for solving sudoku. Where specific skills like spotting naked singles, finding swordfish, etc. can be trained.

## Technical plan

There are two main parts of this project:
    - the "logical" part, where practise problems are generated, and answers checked.
    - the "player" part, where the puzzle is shown to the player, and the players input are handled.
